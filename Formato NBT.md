## Formato NBT en Minecraft:

[Some text](#Formato-NBT-en-Minecraft)

El formato NBT es 
The Named Binary Tag format is used by Minecraft for the various files in which it saves data. The format is described by Notch in a very brief specification. The format is designed to store data in a tree structure made up of various tags. All tags have an ID and a name. The original known version was 19132 as introduced in Minecraft Beta 1.3, and since then has been updated to 19133 with Anvil, with the addition of the Int Array tag. The NBT format dates all the way back to Minecraft Indev with tags 0 to 10 in use.

ID | Icono | Tipo de tag | Payload | Descripci√≥n | Capacidad de almacenamiento
--- | --- | --- | --- | --- | ---
0 | ![TAG_End](http://i.imgur.com/GbbSJOl.png "TAG_End") | TAG_**End** | Nada. | Used to mark the end of compound tags. This tag does not have a name, so it is only ever a single byte 0. It may also be the type of empty List tags. | Sin capacidad para almacenar datos.
1 | ![TAG_Byte](http://i.imgur.com/DLpKqKK.png "TAG_Byte") | TAG_**Byte** | 1 byte / 8 bits, signed | A signed integral type. Sometimes used for booleans. | Rango comprendido entre `-(2^7)` y `2^7 - 1`: Desde `-128` hasta `127`.
2 | ![TAG_Short](http://i.imgur.com/mOTYBeM.png "TAG_Short") | TAG_**Short** |  2 bytes / 16 bits, signed, big endian | A signed integral type. | Rango comprendido entre `-(2^15)` y `2^15 - 1`: Desde `-32.768` hasta `32.767`
3 | ![TAG_Int](http://i.imgur.com/S24DzxI.png "TAG_Int") | TAG_**Int** |  4 bytes / 32 bits, signed, big endian | A signed integral type. | Rango comprendido entre `-(2^31)` y `2^31 - 1`: Desde `-2.147.483.648` hasta `2.147.483.647`
4 | ![TAG_Long](http://i.imgur.com/DUiiE1O.png "TAG_Long") | TAG_**Long** |  8 bytes / 64 bits, signed, big endian | A signed integral type. | Rango comprendido entre `-(2^63)` y `2^63 - 1`: Desde `-9.223.372.036.854.775.808` hasta `9.223.372.036.854.775.807`.
5 | ![TAG_Float](http://i.imgur.com/SzJFi47.png "TAG_Float") | TAG_**Float** | 4 bytes / 32 bits, signed, big endian, IEEE 754-2008, binary32 | A signed floating point type. | Precision varies throughout number line; See Single-precision floating-point format.
6 | ![TAG_Double](http://i.imgur.com/RHW9hx9.png "TAG_Double") | TAG_**Double** | 8 bytes / 64 bits, signed, big endian, IEEE 754-2008, binary64 | A signed floating point type. | Precision varies throughout number line; See Single-precision floating-point format.
7 | ![TAG_Byte_Array](http://i.imgur.com/tOTGqjP.png "TAG_Byte_Array") | TAG_**Byte_Array** | TAG_Int's payload size, then size TAG_Byte's payloads. | An array of bytes. | Maximum number of elements ranges between `2^31 - 9` y `2^31 - 1`: `2.147.483.639` y `2.147.483.647`, depending on the specific JVM.
8 | ![TAG_String](http://i.imgur.com/c2NRyWV.png "TAG_String") | TAG_**String** | TAG_Short's payload length, then a UTF-8 string with size length. | A UTF-8 string. It has a size, rather than being null terminated. | `32.767` UTF-8 Code Points (see UTF-8 format; most commonly-used characters are a single code point).
9 | ![TAG_List](http://i.imgur.com/S7q49GR.png "TAG_List") | TAG_**List** | TAG_Byte's payload tagId, then TAG_Int's payload size, then size tags' payloads, all of type tagId. | A list of tag payloads, without repeated tag IDs or any tag names. | Due to JVM limitations and the implementation of ArrayList, the maximum number of list elements is `2^31 - 9` o `2.147.483.639`. Also note that List and Compound tags may not be nested beyond a depth of `512`.
10 | ![TAG_Compound](http://i.imgur.com/bRuYarV.png "TAG_Compound") | TAG_**Compound** | Fully formed tags, followed by a TAG_End. | A list of fully formed tags, including their IDs, names, and payloads. No two tags may have the same name. | Unlike lists, there is no hard limit to the amount of tags within a Compound (of course, there is always the implicit limit of virtual memory). Note, however, that Compound and List tags may not be nested beyond a depth of `512`.
11 | ![TAG_Int_Array](http://i.imgur.com/9K6IiQm.png "TAG_Int_Array") | TAG_**Int_Array** | TAG_Int's payload size, then size TAG_Int's payloads | An array of TAG_Int's payloads. | Maximum number of elements ranges between `2^31 - 9` and `2^31 - 1`: `2.147.483.639` and `2.147.483.647`, depending on the specific JVM.
